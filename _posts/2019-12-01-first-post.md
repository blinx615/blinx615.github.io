I am beginning this as a side-project to hold my trip reports as well as post any informationg that is interesting to me regarding camping gear and anything backpacking related. The first thing I will be doing is going through previous trips and getting them documented to the best of my memory.

I recently received a Garmin Forerunner 235 and am interested in how I might use the data from this watch to create maps and other fun data analysis visuals for my trip reports.
