    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>I am a {{ 'now' | date: "%Y" | minus: 1987 }} year old husband living in the Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina where I hold a career in the IT field.  I first started getting into hiking and backpacking around fall of 2018 when a friend told me about his annual trips with his uncle to section hike the Appalchian Trail.  Having never heard of this before, I was initially turned off by the idea, but eventually decided to step out of my comfort zone.</p>
        <p>I bought some cheap stuff off of Amazon and in October we hiked up to Ice Water Springs shelter in the Smokey Mountains.  It was a grueling uphill climb but the beautiful picturesque water features kept me in high spirits.  The next morning was rainy and in the 30s, but I couldn't remove the grin from my face.  As soon as we reached the bottom of the mountain I began planning the next trip.</p>
        <p>Since then I've been constantly looking for gear, trip ideas, and reading advice for improving my fitness and comfort on the trail with my eyes set on longer and more physically demanding trips.</p>
